# **Vision** – **Architecture × AI**    

If you came here through the shortcut, feel free to jump straight to `AI Mentor`.

If you somehow read through all my chaos without skipping…  
**Thank you for your patience.**  
**You are stronger than most servers I’ve ever touched.* 

Now let us begin the last part of our journey.

## **My formal self-defense statement**
As you may have sensed, throughout this entire architecture I never actually misused or abused anything.  

I take patterns that are strong but flawed in practice, reshape them into a different form, and handle the trade-offs so we can extract their full benefit safely.  

You may also notice something else
- Each pattern has real value on its own. You can use any of them independently without adopting the full `Chimera` stack.

- When these patterns start working together, their interconnection becomes the real source of power, giving `Chimera` the flexibility and scalability to grow with any level of system complexity.

In the end, `Chimera` is not defined by individual patterns, but by the coherence of the system they form.
That coherence is what enables clarity, stability, and scalable growth as complexity increases.

## **About Chimera**
From the very beginning, my intention with `Chimera` was to design a DLC for `Clean Architecture`, so I try to keep it within that scope.  

Sometimes I wander off the rails and talk about testing, DevOps, or distributed systems, but those parts turned out useful, so I decided to leave them in. They are important after all.

If a microservice system is built on top of robust and scalable monolithic nodes, it becomes much stronger and far less likely to wake you up at 2 AM.

**This is just an idea, but imagine an architecture where every node is a Chimera. You would have a zoo full of monsters under your command.**  

*It might be your childhood dream coming true!*  
*Might be a maintainer’s worst nightmare.*  
*Nobody knows.*  
*But it is definitely epic.*  

## **AI Mentor**

Throughout Chimera I sprinkle jokes on purpose.
They look random, every one of them is actually useful.  
**AI Mentor** means feeding the spec to the AI and asking it to return something valuable in exchange.

Debate with it. (fight it!)  
Make it explain the architecture and the reasoning behind every decision.

While the AI is busy digesting all the chaos, you can sit back and enjoy the jokes and small bits of drama hidden across the document.  
These narrative fragments also work as extra context, helping the AI understand the intention behind each pattern choice.  

You may even ask it to explain the jokes too. I tried it myself, and the result was funny.  

Those narratives also act as additional context, helping the AI understand the purpose and reasoning behind each pattern choice.  

I used scary words like “abuse”, “misuse”, and “hack” on purpose.  
They make the document look slightly wrong, which forces the AI to stay cautious instead of overhyping things.

With the depth and breadth of technical concepts in Chimera, writing everything in a formal tone would make the whole project extremely unfriendly for newcomers.  

A bit of chaos keeps everyone (**including me*) awake

## **AI Colaborator**

Right now all of us are trying to figure out how to workeffectively with AI.
The hardest part is making it consistent.

How do you make a prompt replayable across your whole team
and still get the same result
every time?
Nobody really knows.

One approach is to write extremely detailed prompts and treat them like Canonical Prompts.
But a prompt longer than the generated code
is a terrible deal.

A better approach is to share your project philosophy, backed by well known patterns and solid industry practices.
When the architecture is clear, the AI naturally snaps into the right shape.

My poor AI assistant now can follow `Chimera` better than me.
It usually reminds me when I mess with boundaries.

The funniest part is that the AI understands absolutely nothing.
But it follows rules with perfect discipline,
so it can track `Chimera` surprisingly well
as long as each part stays small, explicit, and predictable.

## **AI Onboarding**

Ok that’s enough hype.
Since I keep talking about AI so much it’s starting to look like a scam, this section is where I try to take cover before you get angry.

#### **1. Before we start**
- With large context like architecture, you should rely on AI memory.  

- Don’t fight against facts or industry standards.  
  AI will argue with you all day and still think it’s right.  

- Each AI model has its own steering bias, so add instructions that keep it from flip flopping  

- Keep your prompt neutral unless you want to manipulate it.  
In Chimera I intentionally use “bad” words so AI stays cautious instead of overhyping things  

#### **2. How to build the context**

1. **Tell the AI that it must follow Chimera.**   
     A short sentence is enough, but it must sound serious.

2. **Feed each README in this repo to the AI one by one.**  
     Then ask it to explain the content back to you  
     Not to learn.  
     But to check whether it understands the boundaries.

3. **Do not reorder the files.**  
     The original order helps the AI understand the interconnection between patterns.

4. **Make sure each Chimera pattern is saved into AI memory.**  
     If the memory system is weak, tag them separately.

5. **Build the architecture template**  
     At this point you can ask the AI to generate it for you

6. **Enjoy the drama**  
     AI will start fighting you on some abuse points  
     This part is fun

7. **Debate and refine the template project**  
     This is where the interconnection between patternsfinally reveals itself.   
     All the small rules, boundaries, and layers begin toclick together.  

     And this is also where you and the AI give eachother battle scars, happy hurting each other.

     This step is important because the fight forces the AI to become consistent, and it forces you to understand why the patterns connect the way they do.
     

**After this stage, you now have:**  
- A solid template project  
- An AI with emotional damage from arguing with you

#### **3. How to onboard new team members**

**Give them**  
- The trained AI  
- The template project  
- The Chimera spec  

**Let them suffer gracefully.** 
- AI will guide them  
- AI tell them where files should go  
- Which pattern to use  
- What to abuse  
- What to avoid  
- And generate code with correct boundaries  

They don’t need to learn anything new before touching the codebase.  
They will learn by fighting Artificial Intelligence Cyborgs (that Glory!)

#### **4. The final stage**
 
At this point the AI has enough **context, knowledge, rules, patterns and psychological trauma** to function like a pseudo senior developer.  
It can review code, suggest architecture, detect problems early, and occasionally create new problems of its own.

## **Mic-drop**
After all, architecture and patterns are simply the ways we try to create software that is robust and predictable.
If no one talks about your idea, that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, you might be a genius or a dumbass or a madman… or all three at the same time.

The only thing that truly matters is understanding.
Understanding what you are doing, what result it creates, what trade-offs it demands, and whether the deal is worth it.

*I am done with my story. It is your turn to make your system epic!*
